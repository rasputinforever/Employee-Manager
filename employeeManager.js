// employee manager
// I installed express... but I don't think we actually needed it.
// INQUIRER is the user interface.

// initiate code
    // mandatory tools:
        // add departments, roles, and employees
            // there's a table for each of these
        // look at departments, roles, and employees -- think about what would be a practical way to 'see' this info
        // update/edite employee roles

    // "extras" suggested to add if possible
        // edit who an employee's manager is
        // view all employees under a manager
        // delete any of the above
            // deleting a manager creates an odd situation where you need to re-assign each employee to a new manager
            // same with departments!
        // combined salaray for a single department
        
// first thing's first... create the db! Can't quite do much without working data.
