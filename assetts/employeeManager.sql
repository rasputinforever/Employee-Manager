-- this is a 'starter' to get a database going for the user
-- include some optional 'starter' data for demonstration purposes

-- Tables We need....

-- department
    -- id
    -- name

-- role
    -- id
    -- title
    -- salary 
    -- department_id (connection)

-- employee
    -- id
    -- first_name
    -- last name
    -- role_id (conn)
    -- manager_id (emp id of that manager)

-- of note is the fact that managers and employees are stored on the same table. Not exactly a big deal.
